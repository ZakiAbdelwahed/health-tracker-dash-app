## 1. Goal
One my goals in life is to live to 100 in the best mental and physical shape possible. Thanks to health tracking devices, we now have access to an array of biometric data. While these devices may not be perfect, they can still give us an idea of our overall health trends. Personally, I use an Oura ring and an Apple Watch. Both devices have great apps with dashboards and graphs, but I wanted to have all my data in one place and add additional graphs. For example, the Oura ring estimates how much REM and deep sleep I get per night, but I can't see how that amount is evolving over time.
Another one of my goals is to run the equivalent of the earth's circumference, this app helps me track my progress (Spoiler alert: I still have a long way to go :wink: :running:)

## 2. Definitions
**HRV**: HRV stands for Heart Rate Variability. It is a measure of the variation in time between successive heartbeats. It is often used as a marker of the nervous system's balance between the sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) branches. HRV can be used to indicate how well the body is adapting to stressors and to assess the overall health of the autonomic nervous system.

**VO2 max**: VO2 max is a measure of the maximum amount of oxygen that a person can consume during intense exercise. It is often used as a measure of cardiovascular fitness and can be improved through training.

**Zone 2**: Zone 2 training is a type of exercise training that involves maintaining a blood lactate concentration of less than 2 mmol which is typically between 60-70% of your maximum heart rate. This type of training is often used for endurance and cardiovascular fitness.
